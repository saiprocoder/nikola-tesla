            <p class="sectionTag text-small">We know how much important the role electricity plays in our lives, wherever we go there is electricity. We cannot imagine our life without electricity, there would be no computers, mobiles, bulbs, fans, etc. We would not be able to work at night. But now, we are spending our lives without electricity and bulbs. But you know who invented electricity? Nikola Tesla invented electricity. He also invented alternating current.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p class="sectionTag text-small">Nikola Tesla was born on 10 July in the year 1856, in Austria. His father's name was Milutin Tesla, and his mother's name was Duke Tesla. His father was a priest and his mother was a housewife. His mother was uneducated but she could repair the small appliances. Nikola's mom had a sharp memory so did Nikola. He studied in a small school. In 1862, Nikola and his parents shifted to Gospic. And, he started his middle schooling. And then, when he was in high school, he had an interest in physics and he was sharp, that he could calculate Integral Calculus in his head. Because of his sharp brain, his teachers thought that he was cheating. In 1873, he graduated. And that time, when people graduated they would call for a celebration. That is why, after he came home, everybody was happy. His father wanted Nikola to work as a priest in the town. But his dream was to join the best Engineering College. But he was ill because he was affected by the disease cholera. Because of this, he was about to die. But his father promised that when he'll recover he would send Nikola to an Engineering College. But, between the Austro-Hungarian army, there was compulsory recruitment. He ran away from home and went to a forest. And he recovered from cholera because of the natural environment. In 1875, he went to the Austrian Polytechnic, where he learned about Michael Faraday's principles deeply. And that time, Nikola used to study from 3 AM to 11 PM. And when Tesla's professor got to know about this, he wrote a letter to Nikola's father about his behaviour. He wrote, convince Tesla or else he would end up losing his life. But, during his second year, he started gambling. Because of gambling, he didn't prepare for his 3rd-year exams. He failed last semester. In 1881, to work in a telegram company he went to Budapest. He improved his knowledge about Central Station. And because of his talent, Diwadar Puskas, who was an inventor, was impressed. So, Diwadar Puskas gave him a job in the Continental Edison Company, which was Thomas Alva Edison's Company.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-small">In this company, his job was to install lighting systems on roads. And this was the time when Edison invented Direct Current. Direct Current only worked in short distances, not long distances. So, Tesla started working on Alternating Current. He wanted to invent such a type of thing that could send current to long distances also and high voltage current could be sent through wires. After finishing the invention, Tesla showed that to Edison. Edison understood that Tesla's invention could take over his invention of Direct Current. So he made fun of Tesla, and he told his invention was dangerous. Edison told him to pay attention to the company's work. And he said that if he would make 24 standard machines, he would give Tesla a 50000$ bonus. At that time 50000$ was a lot. And Nikola made 24 machines in just 6 months. He was also working on his inventions. After making the machines, he showed them to Edison and told Edison to give him the bonus. But Edison did not give a bonus to Tesla. So Tesla was sad, and he left the company. But, he made an Induction Motor that worked on Alternating Current. And when George Westinghouse Jr. knew about this he called Tesla and told Tesla about his need for alternating current for his company. And George hired him as a consultant in his company. But when Edison knew about this, he started fighting with George. To prove the Alternating Current dangerous, Edison did lots of unethical things. He used it on animals. And then, people started believing in Edison. But then, when people got to know more about Alternating Current, they started using Alternating Current. With the money from Alternating Current, he built a laboratory. Tesla died on 7 January 1943.</p>
